# LoRa Basics‚Ñ¢ Station using balena.io with sx1301, sx1302 and sx1303 LoRa concentrators

This project deploys a LoRaWAN gateway with Basics‚Ñ¢ Station Packet Forward protocol with balena. It runs on a Raspberry Pi (3/4) or balenaFin with sx1301, sx1302 and sx1303 LoRa concentrators (e.g. RAK833, RAK2245, RAK2287, RAK 5146 and IMST iC880a among others).


## Introduction

Deploy a The Things Stack (TTS v3) LoRaWAN gateway running the Basics‚Ñ¢ Station Semtech Packet Forward protocol. We are using balena.io and RAK to reduce fricition for the LoRa gateway fleet owners. This project has been tested with The Things Network (TTN v2), The Things Stack (TTS v3) and The Things Industries (TTI) as well.

The Basics‚Ñ¢ Station protocol enables the LoRa gateways with a reliable and secure communication between the gateways and the cloud and it is becoming the standard Packet Forward protocol used by most of the LoRaWAN operators.

## Configure the Gateway

### Define your MODEL

The model is defined depending on the version of the LoRa concentrator: ```SX1301```, ```SX1302``` and ```SX1303```. 

In case that your LoRa concentrator is a ```RAK2287``` it is using ```SX1302```. If the concentrator is the ```RAK2245``` or ```iC880a``` it uses the ```SX1301```. It's important to change the balenaCloud Device Variable with the correct ```MODEL```. The default ```MODEL``` on the balena Application is the ```SX1301```.

1. Go to balenaCloud dashboard and get into your LoRa gateway device site.
2. Click "Device Variables" button on the left menu and change the ```MODEL``` variable to ```SX1302``` if needed.

That enables a fleet of LoRa gateways with both (e.g.) ```RAK2245``` and ```RAK2287``` together under the same app.

### Define your REGION and TTN STACK VERSION

From now it's important to facilitate the ```TTN_STACK_VERSION``` that you are going to use: ```3``` (The Things Stack v3) or ```2``` (The Things Network or TTN V2). The default variable is set into ```3```(V3).

Before starting, also check the ```TTN_REGION```. It needs to be changed if your region is not Europe. In case you use version 3, the European version is ```eu1``` by default. Check [here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequencies-by-country.html) the LoRa frequencies by country.

With these variables ```TTN_REGION``` and ```TTN_STACK_VERSION``` the ```TC_URI``` will be generated automatically. In case that you want to point to another specific ```TC_URI```, feel free to add this Device Variable on the balenaCloud.

### Get the EUI of the LoRa Gateway

The LoRa gateways are manufactured with a unique 64 bits (8 bytes) identifier, called EUI, which can be used to register the gateway on The Things Network and The Things Stack. To get the EUI from your board it‚Äôs important to know the Ethernet MAC address of it (this is not going to work if your device does not have Ethernet port). 

The ```EUI``` will be the Ethernet mac address (6 bytes), which is unique, expanded with 2 more bytes (FFFE). This is a standard way to increment the MAC address from 6 to 8 bytes.

To get the ```EUI```, copy the TAG of the device which will be generated automatically when the device gets provisioned on balenaCloud for first time. Be careful when you copy the tag, as other characters will be copied.

If that does not work, go to the terminal box and click "Select a target", then ‚ÄúHostOS‚Äù. Once you are inside the shell, type:

```cat /sys/class/net/eth0/address | sed -r 's/[:]+//g' | sed -e 's#\(.\{6\}\)\(.*\)#\1fffe\2#g' ```

Copy the result and you are ready to register your gateway with this EUI.


### Configure your The Things Stack gateway (V3)

1. Sign up at [The Things Stack console](https://ttc.eu1.cloud.thethings.industries/console/).
2. Click "Go to Gateways" icon.
3. Click the "Add gateway" button.
4. Introduce the data for the gateway.
5. Paste the EUI from the balenaCloud tags.
6. Complete the form and click Register gateway.
7. Once the gateway is created, click "API keys" link.
8. Click "Add API key" button.
9. Select "Grant individual rights" and then "Link as Gateway to a Gateway Server for traffic exchange ..." and then click "Create API key".
10. Copy the API key generated. and bring it to balenaCloud as ```TC_KEY```.

### Configure your The Things Network gateway (V2)

1. Sign up at [The Things Network console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/).
2. Click Gateways button.
3. Click the "Register gateway" link.
4. Check ‚ÄúI‚Äôm using the legacy packet forwarder‚Äù checkbox.
5. Paste the EUI from the balenaCloud tag or the Ethernet mac address of the board (calculated above)
6. Complete the form and click Register gateway.
7. Copy the Key generated on the gateway page.


### Balena LoRa Basics Station Service Variables

Once successfully registered:

1. Go to balenaCloud dashboard and get into your LoRa gateway device site.
2. Click "Device Variables" button on the left menu and add these variables.

Alternativelly, you can also set any of them at application level if you want it to apply to all devices in you application.


#### Common Variables

Variable Name | Value | Description | Default
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**`GW_GPS`** | `STRING` | Enables GPS | true or false
**`GW_RESET_PIN`** | `INT` | Pin number that resets (Raspberry Pi header number) | 11
**`GW_RESET_GPIO`** | `INT` | GPIO number that resets (Broadcom pin number, if not defined, it's calculated based on the GW_RESET_PIN) | 17
**`TTN_STACK_VERSION`** | `INT` | If using TTN, version of the stack. It can be either 2 (TTNv2) or 3 (TTS) | 3
**`TTN_REGION`** | `STRING` | Region of the TTN server to use | ```eu1``` (when using TTN v2 use ```eu```)
**`TC_TRUST`** | `STRING` | Certificate for the server | Automatically retrieved from LetsEncryt based on the `TTN_STACK_VERSION` value
**`MODEL`** | `STRING` | ```SX1301``` or ```SX1302``` | ```SX1301```
**`TC_URI`** | `STRING` | basics station TC URI to get connected.  | 

#### The Things Stack (TTS) Specific Variables (V3)

Remember to generate an API Key and copy it. It will be the ```TC_KEY```.

The `TC_URI` and `TC_TRUST` values are automatically populated to use ```wss://eu1.cloud.thethings.network:8887``` if you set `TTN_STACK_VERSION` to 3.If your region is not EU you can set it using ```TTN_REGION```. At the moment there is only one server avalable is ```eu1```.

Variable Name | Value | Description | Default
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**`TC_KEY`** | `STRING` | Unique TTN Gateway Key | (Key pasted from TTN console)


#### (Deprecated) The Things Network (TTNv2) Specific Variables (V2)

Remember to copy the The Things Network gateway KEY and ID to configure your board variables on balenaCloud.

The `GW_ID`and `GW_KEY` variables have been generated automatically when the Application has been created with the Deploy with Balena button. Replace the values with the KEY and ID from the TTN console.

The `TC_URI` and `TC_TRUST` values are automatically populated to use ```wss://lns.eu.thethings.network:443``` if you set `TTN_STACK_VERSION` to 2. If your region is not EU you can set it using ```TTN_REGION```, Possible values are ```eu```, ```us```, ```in``` and ```au```.

Variable Name | Value | Description | Default
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**`GW_ID`** | `STRING` | TTN Gateway EUI | (EUI)
**`GW_KEY`** | `STRING` | Unique TTN Gateway Key | (Key pasted from TTN console)


At this moment your LoRaWAN gateway should be up and running. Check on the TTN or TTS console if it shows the connected status.


## Troubleshoothing

It's possible that on the TTN Console the gateway appears as Not connected if it's not receiving any LoRa message. Sometimes the websockets connection among the LoRa Gateway and the server can get broken. However a new LoRa package will re-open the websocket between the Gateway and TTN or TTI. This issue should be solved with the TTN v3.

Feel free to introduce issues on this repo and contribute with solutions.


## TTNv2 to TTS migration

Initial state: one of more devices connected to TTNv2 stack (The Things Network).

Proposed procedure:

1. Create the gateways at TTS using the very same Gateway ID (Gateway EUI)
2. Create a `TC_KEY` variable on each device with the TTN Gateway Key pasted from the TTI console.
3. Set the `TTN_STACK_VERSION` variable to 3, either at application level or per device

Now you can move them from TTS to TTNv2 back and forth (using the `TTN_STACK_VERSION` variable) as you wish as long as the gateways are defined on both platforms and the `TC_KEY` and `GW_KEY` do not change.
